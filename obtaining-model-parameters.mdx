# Obtaining Model Parameters

To use AlphaFold 3 for structure prediction, you need to obtain the model parameters (weights) from Google DeepMind.

<Warning>
  **Important**: You may only use AlphaFold 3 model parameters if received directly from Google. Use is subject to the [AlphaFold 3 Model Parameters Terms of Use](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/WEIGHTS_TERMS_OF_USE.md).
</Warning>

## Request Access

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete the access request form">
    Visit the Google Form to request access to AlphaFold 3 model parameters:
    
    **[Request AlphaFold 3 Model Parameters](https://forms.gle/svvpY4u2jsHEwWYS6)**
    
    You will need to provide:
    - Your name and institutional affiliation
    - Email address
    - Intended use case
    - Agreement to the terms of use
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for approval">
    Access will be granted at Google DeepMind's sole discretion.
    
    <Info>
      **Expected Response Time**: 2-3 business days
    </Info>
    
    You will receive an email notification once your request has been processed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Download the model parameters">
    Once access is granted, you will receive instructions for downloading the model parameters.
    
    Download them to a directory on your system (referred to as `<MODEL_PARAMETERS_DIR>` in the documentation).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Store model parameters">
    Store the model parameters in a location that is:
    - **NOT** a subdirectory of the AlphaFold 3 repository
    - Accessible to your Docker container
    - Has sufficient disk space
    
    <Tip>
      Choose a location like `$HOME/alphafold3_models` or `/data/alphafold3/models` that will be easy to mount in Docker.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Terms of Use

<Warning>
  Before requesting access, carefully review the [AlphaFold 3 Model Parameters Terms of Use](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/WEIGHTS_TERMS_OF_USE.md).
</Warning>

### Key Terms

- **Non-Commercial Use**: The model parameters are subject to specific usage restrictions
- **No Redistribution**: You may not share or redistribute the model parameters
- **Direct from Google**: Parameters must be obtained directly from Google DeepMind
- **Citation Required**: Any publication using the model parameters must cite the AlphaFold 3 paper
- **No Clinical Use**: Not intended, validated, or approved for clinical applications

### Prohibited Uses

The model parameters have specific prohibited use cases. Review the [Prohibited Use Policy](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/WEIGHTS_PROHIBITED_USE_POLICY.md) for complete details.

## Using Model Parameters

Once you have the model parameters, you can use them with AlphaFold 3:

### With Docker

```bash
docker run -it \
    --volume $HOME/af_input:/root/af_input \
    --volume $HOME/af_output:/root/af_output \
    --volume <MODEL_PARAMETERS_DIR>:/root/models \
    --volume <DB_DIR>:/root/public_databases \
    --gpus all \
    alphafold3 \
    python run_alphafold.py \
    --json_path=/root/af_input/fold_input.json \
    --model_dir=/root/models \
    --output_dir=/root/af_output
```

The `--model_dir` flag should point to the directory containing your model parameters (mounted at `/root/models` inside the container).

### With Singularity

```bash
singularity exec \
     --nv \
     --bind $HOME/af_input:/root/af_input \
     --bind $HOME/af_output:/root/af_output \
     --bind <MODEL_PARAMETERS_DIR>:/root/models \
     --bind <DB_DIR>:/root/public_databases \
     alphafold3.sif \
     python run_alphafold.py \
     --json_path=/root/af_input/fold_input.json \
     --model_dir=/root/models \
     --db_dir=/root/public_databases \
     --output_dir=/root/af_output
```

## Alternative: AlphaFold Server

If you don't need the full flexibility of the local installation, you can use AlphaFold 3 through the web interface:

<Card title="AlphaFold Server" icon="cloud" href="https://alphafoldserver.com">
  Use AlphaFold 3 online for non-commercial research without requiring model parameters or local installation.
  
  **Available at**: [alphafoldserver.com](https://alphafoldserver.com)
  
  **Note**: The server has a more limited set of ligands and covalent modifications compared to the local installation.
</Card>

### When to Use AlphaFold Server

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use the Server When:" icon="check">
    - You need quick predictions for standard cases
    - You don't have access to GPU infrastructure
    - Your use case is covered by available ligands
    - You prefer a web interface
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Local Installation When:" icon="server">
    - You need custom ligands or SMILES
    - You require high throughput predictions
    - You need full control over MSA and templates
    - You want to run on your own infrastructure
    - You need complex covalent modifications
  </Card>

## Citation Requirements

<Info>
  Any publication that discloses findings arising from using the model parameters or outputs produced by them must cite the AlphaFold 3 paper.

## Troubleshooting

### Model Directory Not Found

If you get an error about the model directory:

```bash
# Verify the directory exists and contains model files
ls -la <MODEL_PARAMETERS_DIR>

# Check Docker volume mount
docker run -it \
    --volume <MODEL_PARAMETERS_DIR>:/root/models \
    alphafold3 \
    ls -la /root/models
```

### Permission Issues

```bash
# Ensure the model directory has appropriate permissions
chmod 755 <MODEL_PARAMETERS_DIR>
```
