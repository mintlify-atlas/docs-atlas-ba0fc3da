## JAAG: JSON Assembler for AlphaFold 3 (with Glycan Integration)

### Overview

JAAG is a lightweight, web-based GUI tool that helps generate AlphaFold 3 input JSON files with integrated glycan support. It automates the creation of correct glycan syntax, reducing manual errors when preparing glycoprotein or glycan-protein complexes.

### Key Features

- **Web-based interface**: No installation required
- **Glycan support**: Automated glycan syntax generation
- **CCD integration**: Correct Chemical Component Dictionary codes
- **Bonded atom pairs**: Automatic generation of `bondedAtomPairs` syntax
- **Error reduction**: Validates input and prevents common mistakes
- **User-friendly**: Intuitive GUI for non-programmers

### Use Cases

- Modeling glycoproteins
- Creating glycan-protein complexes
- Setting up covalent modifications
- Learning AlphaFold 3 JSON format
- Rapid prototyping of input files

### Access and Resources

- **Web app**: [https://biofgreat.org/JAAG](https://biofgreat.org/JAAG)
- **Source code**: [https://github.com/chinchc/JAAG](https://github.com/chinchc/JAAG)
- **Paper**: [https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwaf083](https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwaf083)

### Compatibility

<Warning>
  JAAG is compatible with **standalone AlphaFold 3** installations only. It is **not** compatible with the AlphaFold 3 server at alphafoldserver.com.
</Warning>

### Getting Started with JAAG

1. Visit the [JAAG web app](https://biofgreat.org/JAAG)
2. Input your protein sequence
3. Add glycan structures using the GUI
4. Configure bonded atom pairs
5. Export the generated JSON file
6. Use the JSON file with your local AlphaFold 3 installation

### When to Use This Resource

<Info>
  This resource is especially useful if your AlphaFold 3 ligand models appear **stereochemically incorrect**.
</Info>

- Glycan models look distorted
- Unexpected bond angles or lengths
- Clashes in glycan structures
- Learning how to model complex carbohydrates
- Understanding AlphaFold 3's capabilities and limitations

### Access and Resources

- **Paper**: [https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwaf048](https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwaf048)
- **ModelArchive**: [https://doi.org/10.5452/ma-af3glycan](https://doi.org/10.5452/ma-af3glycan)

### Key Takeaways from the Paper

1. **AlphaFold 3 can model many glycan types** with good accuracy
2. **Careful input preparation is critical** for success
3. **Validation is essential** - don't trust predictions blindly
4. **Some glycan classes are more challenging** than others
5. **Stereochemistry must be checked** carefully in outputs

### Example Applications

- **Glycoproteins**: Modeling antibodies with N-glycosylation
- **Lectins**: Predicting lectin-glycan interactions
- **Glycan arrays**: Screening multiple glycan structures
- **Drug discovery**: Modeling glycan-binding proteins with inhibitors
