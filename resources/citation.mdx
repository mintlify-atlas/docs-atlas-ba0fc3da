## Disclaimer

<Warning>
  AlphaFold 3 and its outputs are for theoretical modeling only. Not intended, validated, or approved for clinical use.
</Warning>

AlphaFold 3 outputs are predictions with varying confidence levels and should be interpreted carefully. Always:

- Validate predictions experimentally when possible
- Check confidence scores (pLDDT, ranking scores)
- Use discretion before relying on predictions
- Do not use for clinical or medical decisions
- Clearly communicate prediction uncertainty in publications
