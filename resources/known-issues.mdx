## Numerical Performance for CUDA Capability 7.x GPUs

<Warning>
  All CUDA Capability 7.x GPUs (e.g. V100) produce obviously bad output, with lots of clashing residues.
</Warning>

### Issue Description

When running AlphaFold 3 on CUDA Capability 7.x GPUs (such as the V100), the model produces poor quality predictions with:
- Lots of clashing residues
- Ranking scores of -99 or lower
- Generally unusable output

### Workaround

Set the `XLA_FLAGS` environment variable to include the following flag:

```bash
export XLA_FLAGS="--xla_disable_hlo_passes=custom-kernel-fusion-rewriter"
```

When running with Docker, pass this environment variable:

```bash
docker run -it \
    --env XLA_FLAGS="--xla_disable_hlo_passes=custom-kernel-fusion-rewriter" \
    --volume $HOME/af_input:/root/af_input \
    --volume $HOME/af_output:/root/af_output \
    --volume <MODEL_PARAMETERS_DIR>:/root/models \
    --volume <DATABASES_DIR>:/root/public_databases \
    --gpus all \
    alphafold3 \
    python run_alphafold.py \
    --json_path=/root/af_input/fold_input.json \
    --model_dir=/root/models \
    --output_dir=/root/af_output
```

### Affected Hardware

- NVIDIA V100 GPUs
- All other CUDA Capability 7.x GPUs

## Incorrect Handling of Two-Letter Atoms in SMILES Ligands

<Info>
  This issue was fixed in commit [4e4023c](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/commit/4e4023c).
</Info>

### Issue Description

Between commits [f8df1c7](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/commit/f8df1c7) and [4e4023c](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/commit/4e4023c), AlphaFold 3 handled incorrectly any two-letter atoms in ligands defined using SMILES strings.

### Affected Atoms

Two-letter atoms such as:
- Chlorine (Cl)
- Bromine (Br)
- Other two-letter atomic symbols

### Resolution

This issue has been resolved in the current version. If you are using an older version of AlphaFold 3, please update to the latest version or ensure you are using a commit after [4e4023c](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/commit/4e4023c).
