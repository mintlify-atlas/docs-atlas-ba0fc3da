## Running Predictions

<Accordion title="How long does a prediction take?">
  Prediction time depends on several factors:

  **Data pipeline** (genetic searches):
  - Simple proteins: 1-4 hours
  - Complex proteins: 4-24 hours
  - Very large complexes: 24-48+ hours

  **Inference** (GPU):
  - Small proteins (&lt;200 residues): 5-15 minutes
  - Medium proteins (200-500 residues): 15-45 minutes
  - Large complexes (>500 residues): 45 minutes - 2 hours

  <Info>
    You can run data pipeline and inference separately using `--run_data_pipeline` and `--run_inference` flags.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I run multiple predictions in parallel?">
  Yes, with caveats:

  - **Data pipeline**: Can run multiple in parallel if you have enough CPU and RAM
  - **Inference**: Limited by GPU memory - typically 1-2 predictions per GPU depending on complex size

  For maximum efficiency:
  1. Run data pipeline on CPU-only machines in parallel
  2. Run inference sequentially or on multiple GPUs
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is a model seed and how many should I use?">
  A model seed controls the random initialization of the neural network. Using multiple seeds generates diverse predictions.

  **Recommendations:**
  - **Standard use**: 5 seeds (`"modelSeeds": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`)
  - **Quick testing**: 1 seed
  - **High confidence needed**: 10+ seeds

  The model ranks all predictions, with the best one typically selected.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I stop and resume a prediction?">
  **Data pipeline**: Cannot be easily resumed - must restart if interrupted

  **Inference**: Cannot be resumed - must rerun if interrupted

  <Warning>
    Save your data pipeline outputs to avoid rerunning expensive genetic searches.
  </Warning>

  Best practices:
  - Run data pipeline separately with `--run_data_pipeline=true --run_inference=false`
  - Save MSA and template outputs
  - Run inference later with pre-computed data
</Accordion>
